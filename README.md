## Project Objective
The objective of the project is to create a simple Kanban Board with three columns for tasks:
1) To Do: this is where the task is initially defined and categorized.
2) In Progress: this is the column were tasks are placed while being worked.
3) Completed: this is the column where tasks are placed when completed.

Tasks can be edited, deleted, and moved between columns.  Movement can be made by selecting a column from the drop (select) list, or by dragging and dropping a task panel to a different column.

Task persistence is maintained by storing all task data in the browser's local storage.
